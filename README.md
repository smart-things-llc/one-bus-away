An attempt to create an open source app for PSTA in Pinellas County

Hi, happy new year and welcome to my github page!  I am setting this page up to develop a Free App for the PSTA bus system in Pinelllas County, Florida.  I have used the OBA App in Tampa, but coming down to Clearwater area, I found there is no app here.

Please review the app and comment on any features and how we can develop a new app for the needs of Pinellas County.

Thanks,
Cal Sean Tiger
